# EZBudget
This is a small budget application coded in C# (WPF) that allows you to create a budget and generate multiple statistics.
This application follows for the most part the MVVM convention and uses a local SQL express database.
I'm also using LINQ for the DB queries with asynchronous methods.

My goal for this project was to learn how to use the WPF framework with the most "modern" practices.
